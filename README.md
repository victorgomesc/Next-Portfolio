<p align="left">Next Portfolio is a project that I developed with the aim of showing my skills and competencies on an interactive web page, I included several sections talking about myself, my experiences, my skills, and my previous projects.</p>

<p>Using React, Next.js and Tailwind CSS to create a web page offers a powerful combination of efficiency, flexibility and performance. Here is a brief summary of each technology and how they complement each other:</p>

<h4>React:</h4>
<lu>
  <li>It is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces (UI) efficiently and modularly.</li>
  <li>It makes it easier to create reusable components, which makes code more organized and scalable.</li>
  <li>It offers a reactive and fast experience thanks to Virtual DOM.</li>
</lu>

<h4>Next.js</h4>
<lu>
  <li>It is a React-based framework that adds essential features for modern applications.</li>
  <li>Supports server-side rendering (SSR) and static page generation (SSG), improving performance and SEO.</li>
  <li>It has automatic routing and built-in optimization tools like image loading and code splitting.</li>
</lu>

<h4>Tailwind CSS</h4>
<lu>
  <li>It is a highly customizable CSS utility library that allows you to quickly create responsive designs.</li>
  <li>It eliminates the need to write custom CSS for every detail, speeding up development.</li>
  <li>Works well with React components, allowing styles directly in JSX.</li>
</lu>
